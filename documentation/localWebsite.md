# Local Website
When running the development stack, a website is available at http://info.local.test/ with links to any web interfaces offered by
the other containers in the stack, any generated documentation, and the output from the various testing suites.

If you add your own containers or tools and would like to edit this site, it is available at **containers/support/info/index.html**.
Note that you will need to rebuild the container for changes to take effect.
