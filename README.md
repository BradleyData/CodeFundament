# About
This project aims to provide an extremely light-weight but opinionated framework for building 3 layer (front-end, api, back-end) applications using docker containers. It should be easy to create new applications that can be developed on any platform with a minimum of configuration and setup.
Deployment can happen using docker-compose for development purposes or docker swarm for production.
